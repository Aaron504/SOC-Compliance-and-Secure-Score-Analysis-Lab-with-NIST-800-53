In this lab, I inspected the Microsoft Defender for Cloud (MDC) Secure Score and reviewed security recommendations to enhance the environment's security posture. I enabled the MDC Regulatory Compliance feature and aligned its recommendations with the NIST 800-53 framework, ensuring comprehensive compliance tracking. The lab also involved comparing NIST 800-53 guidelines with MDC recommendations to identify gaps and overlaps. Additionally, I prepared for the implementation of control SC-7, which highlights the complexities of real-world change management processes. This lab demonstrates my ability to analyze security metrics and align cloud environments with industry-standard compliance frameworks.
